        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <div class="SumText"><p>My name is Paul, and I'm looking to change careers.  
        I have always had a passion for working with computers, and until recently it has only been a hobby.</p>
       <p>The past ten years I have been working in retail, 8 of which has been in management.
         After having a stagnant career for the past 6 years with no opportunity for upward movement, I have decided to transition over to my passion - working with computers.</p>
         <p>I have a 4 year old son, who is very much into Superheroes, riding his Big Wheel, and "fighting bad guys."</p>
         <p>Originally my family and I are from Maryland.  We moved to Utah in July of 2017 to be closer to my father.  My mother followed us in November of 2017.</p>
